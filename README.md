Welcome to this project. This is the first thing I have ever built with Python!

# Index Weight and Market Cap Calculator 

# QUESTIONS TO SOLVE WITH CODE
1. Use marketcap to calculate the weight for each constituent for every rebalance period.
Information I had: Date, Ticker, & marketcap
Solution formatted in Excel in Q1_calculatedweight.xlsx

2. Market Capitalization is calculated using the following formula: (unadjusted price) * (Number of Shares) * (Float Factor) = Market Cap. Use unadjusted price (UP), Number of Shares (NOSH), Float Factor (NOSHFF) to calculate the market cap for each security for the last day of every month.
Information I had: Unadjusted Price, Number of Shares Float Factor, Number of Shares & Dates From Dec 2019 to January 2021 across 3 different spreadsheets
Solution formatted in Excel in Q2_calculatedweight.xlsx
